## Room-Temperature Superconductors: Materials, Theory, and Applications

Factors Influencing High Critical Temperatures in Conventional Superconductors

A high Debye temperature is indeed important for achieving high critical temperatures (Tc) in conventional superconductors, as it indicates a stiff lattice with high-frequency phonons, which contribute to stronger electron-phonon coupling. However, other crucial material properties play a significant role \[1\].

Strong, Q-dependent electron-phonon coupling is essential \[1\]. This means that the strength of the interaction between electrons and phonons should vary significantly with the momentum transfer (Q) during the scattering process \[1\]. This can be achieved by carefully designing the electronic and phononic structures of the material \[1\]. Two-dimensional electronic structures with circular Fermi surfaces offer excellent control over Q-dependence \[1\]. However, if this Q-dependence is not well-controlled, it can lead to structural instabilities, even with moderate coupling strength \[1\].

Involving as many phonon branches as possible in the coupling process is also crucial \[1\]. This enhances the overall electron-phonon interaction and contributes to higher Tc.

Quantum Nuclear Effects and Limitations in Theoretical Methods

In hydrogen-rich solids, the light mass of hydrogen atoms leads to significant quantum nuclear effects, such as zero-point energy and large nuclear fluctuations \[2, 3\]. These quantum effects can dramatically impact the stability and superconducting properties of these materials \[2, 3\]. For instance, in LaH10, quantum effects stabilize the high-symmetry Fm3\*-m structure, which exhibits high Tc, over a wide pressure range \[3, 4\]. These effects lower the classical instability pressure by over 100 GPa \[3\].

Current theoretical methods face challenges in accurately accounting for these quantum nuclear effects \[3\]. Standard density functional theory (DFT) calculations are typically performed within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, which assumes that the nuclei are stationary \[5, 6\]. This approximation breaks down in systems with significant nuclear quantum effects \[6\].

Moreover, the large anharmonic vibrations in hydrogen-rich solids necessitate going beyond the harmonic approximation typically used in phonon calculations \[3\]. Accurately incorporating these effects requires computationally expensive methods like variational approaches, such as the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation \[7\]. These limitations highlight the need for further development of theoretical techniques to better capture the intricate interplay of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom in these materials.

Potential Applications of RTSC in Quantum Computing

RTSC materials hold immense potential for revolutionizing quantum computing and quantum information processing. While specific applications are still being explored, here are some promising areas:

‚óè Quantum Interconnects and Circuits: RTSC could enable the development of highly efficient interconnects and circuits for quantum computers, reducing energy loss and signal degradation during quantum information transfer. This could significantly improve the scalability and performance of quantum computers.

‚óè Superconducting Quantum Sensors: Highly sensitive superconducting sensors, such as SQUIDs (Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices), are already used in various applications \[8\]. RTSC materials could enhance the sensitivity and performance of these sensors, leading to advancements in medical imaging, materials science, and fundamental physics research.

‚óè Topological Quantum Computing: RTSC could play a crucial role in the development of topological quantum computers, which are theorized to be inherently more resistant to decoherence. Certain superconducting materials, like UTe2, are considered potential topological superconductors, offering a promising platform for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation \[9\].

The advent of RTSC could significantly impact the development and scalability of quantum computing technologies, potentially accelerating the realization of practical quantum computers capable of solving complex problems that are intractable for classical computers.

## Room-Temperature Superconductivity: Challenges and Promises

Room-temperature superconductors are materials that can exhibit superconductivity at operating temperatures of or above 25 degrees C (approximately 300 degrees K). \[1, 2\] Superconductivity is the ability of certain materials to conduct direct (DC) electrical current with practically zero resistance when they are cooled below a certain temperature, known as the critical temperature (Tc). \[3\] This phenomenon allows for the lossless transmission of electrical power. \[4\] The discovery of room-temperature superconductors would be a major breakthrough in physics and materials science, and it would have profound implications for society. \[4\]

Several materials have been reported to be room-temperature superconductors, but none of these reports has been confirmed nor acknowledged by the mainstream condensed matter physics community. \[1, 2\] The challenge of achieving superconductivity at or near room temperature (around 293K, or 20¬∞C) and at ambient pressure remains a holy grail of physics and materials science. \[4\] The search for room-temperature superconductivity has captivated scientists for over a century, and it has led to numerous breakthroughs and disappointments. \[4\]

One promising area of research in room-temperature superconductivity is the study of high-pressure hydrides. In 2015, researchers reported that hydrogen sulfide (H3S) exhibits superconductivity at 203K when subjected to high pressure. \[5, 6\] This discovery was followed by the observation of superconductivity at 260K in lanthanum hydride (LaH10) under high pressure. \[5, 7\] These findings suggest that hydrogen-rich materials may be the key to achieving room-temperature superconductivity. \[5, 8\]

In 2020, researchers reported the discovery of room-temperature superconductivity in a carbonaceous sulfur hydride at a pressure of 267 GPa. \[9-11\] This breakthrough was a major milestone in the search for room-temperature superconductivity, but the high pressure required to achieve superconductivity in this material limits its practical applications. \[10, 11\] The paper reporting this finding was later retracted. \[10, 11\]

There are a number of technical challenges that need to be addressed in order to develop practical room-temperature superconductors.

These challenges include:

‚óè The need to reduce the pressure required to achieve superconductivity.

‚óè The need to develop materials that are stable and can be manufactured on a large scale.

‚óè The need to develop a better understanding of the mechanisms of superconductivity. \[12\]

Advances in theoretical and experimental techniques are helping to overcome these challenges.

Some of the most promising directions in superconductivity research include:

‚óè The development of new materials with strong electron-phonon coupling. \[13\]

‚óè The exploration of new superconducting mechanisms, such as those based on electronic polarization or spin fluctuations. \[14, 15\]

‚óè The use of machine learning and artificial intelligence to accelerate the discovery of new superconductors. \[16-20\]

The quest for room-temperature superconductivity is a challenging but exciting endeavor. If successful, it would revolutionize many aspects of our lives, from energy transmission and storage to transportation and computing. \[4, 21, 22\]
